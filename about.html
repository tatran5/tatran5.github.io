                Hello! As you probably already know, my name is Thy Tran. I'm currently
                an undergraduate student in Computer Science :: Digital Media Design at
                University of Pennsylvania. You can find detailed information about my major
                <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html">here</a>
                .
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm passionate about computer science in general. My concentration so far
                however have been on computer graphics. However, I'm not only excited by
                computer graphics, I'm also interested in software development, and cannot wait
                to learn more about AI, machine learning, computer vision, algorithm, etc.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also love to draw, read books, listen to film analysis and play games!
                <br>
                <br>
