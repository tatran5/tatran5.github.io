            Hello! My name is Thy Tran. I'm currently
            an undergraduate student in Computer Science :: Digital Media Design at
            University of Pennsylvania. You can find detailed information about my major
            <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html">here</a>. I also submatriculated to the program Master of Science in Computer and Information Science at UPenn.
            .
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm passionate about computer science in general. My concentration so far
            however have been on computer graphics. However, I'm not only excited by
            computer graphics, I'm also interested in software development, and cannot wait
            to learn more about AI, machine learning, computer vision, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also love to draw, read books, listen to film analysis and play games!
            <br>
